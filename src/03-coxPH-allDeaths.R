#TO do:


#2)
# We will analyze anthropometry status using the last anthropometry measurement before death, excluding measurements 
# occurring more than 6 months prior to death, or less than 1 week to avoid bias from potential reverse causation
 #Need to recreate "ever" variables from "cumsum" variables after 

   #do this by checking the diff between agedays and death in the last obs for children who died
   #drop the child from the analysis if not. Coded like this:
   # d <- d %>% group_by(studyid, subjid) %>% 
   #     mutate(diff_death = ifelse(dead==1, agedth - agedays, NA),
   #            drop_due_to_time_gap = max(ifelse(diff_death > 30.4167*6 | diff_death < 7, 1, 0))) %>%
   #     filter(drop_due_to_time_gap!=1)
   #Note... this may be dropping too many children... investigate further


#3)
# We also will repeat the above analyses using different age ranges, starting at birth and ending at the following ages: 
#   birth, one month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

#4) run with and without imputed age of death

#5) add covariate adjustment

#6) double check the coding of cumulative incidence analysis
   #-also, should this impose a certain number of measurements? 
   #I.e ever stunting might be biased comparing kids with >8 measurements to neonatal deaths with 1 measurements

#7) MUAC analysis
